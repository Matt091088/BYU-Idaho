Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
This semester, while working on the budget project in Python, 
I gained a better understanding of the importance of using functions to enhance code modularity and reusability. 
By breaking the program into smaller functions, the different parts of the budgeting process, such as obtaining codes, calculations, and generating PDFs, became more efficient. 
This allowed me to isolate issues and improve them more easily.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions act as a safety net, allowing for quick identification and correction of errors. This is very helpful in detecting issues early in the development process.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I suppose the best way is to first identify the specific problem by examining error messages, 
then use print statements to trace the program's execution flow, pinpoint the cause, 
and also seek information or help from colleagues to find the best solution.
